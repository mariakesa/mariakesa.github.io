        Hi there! My name is Maria and I have a dream.
        I want to live in a world where neuroscience research is accessible 
        to anyone, a world where science comes alive outside of academic journals.       <!-- promiss fulfilled -->
    </p>

    <p>
        I am doing research to elucidate the following question: "What neural codes underlie visual object recognition in the mouse brain?"
    </p>

    <p>
        This blog is a record of my research as it continuously evolves. I try to use as much animation and interactive
        visualizations as possible:-) I hope you enjoy it!
    </p>

“Does a single presynaptic neuron project into different postsynaptic neurons in structured, low-dimensional dendritic patterns?”

“Does presynaptic neuron target dendritic locations non-randomly across its postsynaptic partners?”

do different presynaptic neurons have distinct “projection signatures” in dendritic space?

We propose to characterize dendrites as sorting devices by analyzing how individual presynaptic 
neurons distribute their synapses across the dendritic trees of their postsynaptic targets. For 
a fixed presynaptic neuron, we encode each postsynaptic target as a vector describing the dendritic 
locations (branch identity and normalized arclength) of that presynaptic neuron’s synapses on the target neuron. 
Stacking these vectors across all postsynaptic targets yields a matrix capturing the axon’s projection pattern into 
dendritic space. Applying unsupervised dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) to this matrix reveals low-dimensional 
motifs of dendritic targeting, corresponding to structured “projection modes” of the presynaptic neuron. By comparing 
these embeddings to null models in which synapse locations are randomly permuted along dendrites, we test whether observed 
targeting patterns reflect non-random, potentially computationally meaningful sorting of inputs by dendritic geometry.

PCA on 
X
X finds dominant axes of how this axon distributes synapses in dendritic geometry.

These axes are projection modes:

stereotyped ways the axon “chooses” dendritic subdomains.

We factor each axon’s dendritic targeting pattern into a small set of nonnegative synaptic motifs. 
Each motif corresponds to a spatially coherent pattern of synapse placement.
 We then probe the neuron by selectively activating these motifs, treating them as interpretable basis functions for dendritic input.

		Hi! My name is Maria. I want to write a book
		on neural data analysis (calcium imaging, NeuroPixel probe data)
		with Javascript based interactive elements. In my day job,
		I'm a machine learning engineer working on applying
		Natural Language Processing
		algorithms (ie Transformers) to legal and police data.

		The images above show the sensitivity pattern
		to stimuli in the visual space of groups
		of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1)
		of the mouse. Images that the mice were
		viewing were regressed against these
		neural activity components to visualize
		the ensemble receptive fields of cortical
		cells.

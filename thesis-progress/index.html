        <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p class="text">
                Deep neural networks learn representations of stimuli. This is 
                convenient for visual neuroscience, firstly because the images
                and movies presented to an animal can be transformed so that we
                can study p(response|f(stimulus)) instead of p(response|stimulus).
                Neural networks map visual stimuli from pixel space to another vector 
                space such that information of interest can be easily (linearly) decoded 
                from this representation. This means that they disentangle information
                in the pixel space of the image into dimensions that have some semantic
                or (as we speculate) ethological meaning. Deep neural networks are convenient
                models, because we can obtain these re-representations of stimuli by 
                simply training a model to minimize a cost function on a task. Some tasks
                such as self-supervised learning don't even require labeled data!

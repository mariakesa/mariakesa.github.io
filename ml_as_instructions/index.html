    <h1>Machine Learning as Instruction Sets for Data</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>
            The popularity of Harry Potter is an indication 
            of how the human kind is endlessly fascinated by the idea of magic.
            I am not a stranger to this fascination. As a child, I dreamt
            of mind-reading, teleportation, healing powers. I grew up and 
            became a scientist and found a confirmation to the famous quote 
            "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

            This book is an attempt to explore the "magic" of machine learning algorithms
            through visual presentation and a conceptual approach that views them as 
            <i>instruction sets</i> learned from data. 
            With the advent of Large Language Models, it is almost certain that this
            technology will help us gain greater control over the universe. However,
            even though we're able to create and train these systems, we are left
            wondering how they work. Information about how these "magic spell" algorithms
            work is buried in dense research papers, graduate level courses and massive
            repositories. This book is my attempt to make sense of it all in a way
            that is helpful for anybody who wants to better understand these "spells".

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>
            The popularity of Harry Potter is an indication 
            of how the human kind is endlessly fascinated by the idea of magic.
            I am not a stranger to this fascination. As a child, I dreamt
            of mind-reading, teleportation, healing powers. I grew up and 
            became a scientist and found a confirmation to the famous quote 
            "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
